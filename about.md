## Purpose
This blog is primarily a Tech blog talking about Quadcopters; building them and the trials and tribulations therein. I will also write about other things that interest me tech related. 

By day I am software developer, and by night I do much the same.
I primarily work in Perl and C++.

##My current projects are:
* Building a Quadcopter Platform that is cheap (around $150) and easy to make. This platform is for modding and for the general community to make. Eventually the end goal is to build a quadcopter swarm that communicates with ground robots. 
* Building a robotic remote controlled car using a Beagle Bone Black, GPS and full Inertial Measurement Unit. This is a long term project teaching me about how to use Robotic Operating System and how all these different system interact with each other.
* Learning about web development Ruby and JS hence this blog.
