## Purpose
This blog is pirmary a Tech blog talking about Quadcopters; building them and the trials and tribulations therein. I will also write about other things that interest me tech related. 

By day I am software developer, and by night I do much the same.
I primarily work in Perl and C++.

I am writing this blog to learn about Ruby and web development.

##My current projects are:
* Building a cheap Quadcopter Platform to expand. This is pimaraly from 
* Building a robotic remote contolled car using a Beagle Bone Black, GPS and full Inertial Measurement Unit
* Leanring about web development hence this blog.









They say three times the charm, so here is another free responsive Jekyll theme for you. I've learned a ton since open sourcing my first two themes [on Github](http://github.com/mmistakes), and wanted to try a few new things this time around. If you've used my previous themes most of this should be familiar territory...


* Readable typography to make your words shine.

<div markdown="0"><a href="{{ site.url }}/theme-setup" class="btn btn-info">Install the Theme</a></div>
