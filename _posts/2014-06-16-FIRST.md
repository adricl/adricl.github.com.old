I am primarily writing this blog to learn about Ruby and other web technologies. I will be writing about Quadcopters and other personal projects. My goals is to write a sort of diary about my work and a sort of go to knowledge about problems that can occur and how to solve them.

My current project is building a low cost Quadcopter:

![Early version of my Easy to build Quadcopter.]({{ site.url }}/images/post_images/copter test.jpg)

This project came about because I was looking at smaller ground based robots that are meshed-network at the [Community Connected Hackerspace](http://www.hackmelbourne.org/). It was sugested that we could build a quadcopter that people could learn with, a sort of kit form for members to build and learn with.
We also though this could also link in with other meshed robots and eventually we could use it as a command and controll platform. 

So I decided to build one. I have had experience at building Quadcopters. This is my old one, note the wombat holding it down so it canâ€™t take off.

This design had to be flexible so people can mod easily, adding and removing parts. It had to be cheap. I am aiming to keep it under $150. Has to work! This is harder than it looks!

For this project early on I decided to use a laser cutter and build it from acrylic. This is due to time on a 3d printer being so expensive. 
After searching for designs I came across the [Flone](http://www.instructables.com/id/Flone/) This was a nice design that fulfilled my requirements. 
[Original DXF Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:113497)

My design is [here](https://github.com/adricl/Quadcopter-Frame) please note this design changes from time to time as I make more improvements. 

I made the frame larger to suit the larger blades 7x4.5 Three Blade Counter Rotating Propeller as these had the power I wanted for the motors I have.

Bill of Materials will come in the next post as I finalise them all.
